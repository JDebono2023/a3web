/* Formatting for responsive design was originally set up for a large window.
We had realized that the window on a computer would be responsive, but a mobile
wouldn't actually show the responsive design, so I we decided to format it for a mobile
first, then change the design as the screen got larger. */

link is on their own with their own set of padding (14px horizontal 
and 16px vertical) I didn't change it from what was shown in the 
w3schools tutorial for the navigation bar because it just worked with 
my layout. I did play around with it, which is why I know the first size 
is horizontal and the second is vertical. I make the color of the link 
text white, align them to the center of their respective boxes, remove 
their underline with "text-decoration: none" and give them a dashed 
border to the right of each block with border-right: 2px dashed white
