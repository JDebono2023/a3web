            includes specializations in applications and cartography. Students in this Ontario Post-Graduate Certificate Program are able
            to use high-end technology to solve real world problems. The team in Charlotte's Web are can come up with
            unique solutions tailored to your needs. Whether it is in the domain of programming, mapping or database design, we can help.
        </p>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Sample text - This course will engage students in the exploration of the cartographic communication process. 
            Effective geographical display is dependent upon the decisions involved in its design, such as colour, symbology, and typography in map making. 
            Students will also be introduced to concepts and processes that are central to cartography, enabling the student to build a cartographic foundation for subsequent studies. 
            Industry standard, graphic design software will be used to create various paper products and screen images.
