/* for the links I set them to float to the left so that they sit on 
top of the images and their background. It's part of my design plan 
and I think it works really well. I also display them as block so each 
link is on their own with their own set of padding (14px horizontal 
and 16px vertical) I didn't change it from what was shown in the 
w3schools tutorial for the navigation bar because it just worked with 
my layout. I did play around with it, which is why I know the first size 
is horizontal and the second is vertical. I make the color of the link 
text white, align them to the center of their respective boxes, remove 
their underline with "text-decoration: none" and give them a dashed 
border to the right of each block with border-right: 2px dashed white 
(2px width) */
