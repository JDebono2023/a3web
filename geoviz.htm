        <h2>Geoviz' Tech Focus 1</h2>
        <p>We will build on your project in the same way we have built on our own skillsets.
            We understand how to isolate specific areas at whatever scale you would like to have
            your area displayed at. We have a depth of understanding regarding various map projections
            to ensure the least amount of distortion to your area as possible. We know where to source
            the data you need and we know how to manipulate it to make sure your vision is put to paper.

        <p>We are able to label anything you need to convey the message you wish to share to the world
            on your map. We understand that maps are not just a visual piece of art but a story. We
            can customize the size, shape, position, and behaviour of your labels to suit your needs.
            Understanding visual hierarchy for text on maps is a very important part of cartography
            and you will need to look no further than our group of experts. We have done this more times
            than we can all count and have done it successfully.

        <h2>Geoviz' Tech Focus 1</h2>
        <p>We can put the ART back in cARTography by incorporating colour schemes to ensure your map
            stands out. We understand how colours can clash and compliment we manipulate where people's
            eyes want to go to make sure your message is clear and never missed. Applying isual hierarchy
            with respect to colour saturation, hue and transparency to make the stronger features hit home
            and the base features elaborate on the main story being told is one of our many strengths.

        <p>We are able to use various tools to run habitat suitability analyses to showcase areas that
            are more likely to hold specific animals. Whatever your needs, we are able to show your data 
            in a visually stunning way that can then be used as a tool itself. From acquiring to inspiring,
            we know how to make your project shine. We can even add customized images for personal touches to
            your project to really make it your own. If you want it on your map, don't hesitate to ask.
