<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Sample text - This course will engage students in the exploration of the cartographic communication process. 
    Effective geographical display is dependent upon the decisions involved in its design, such as colour, symbology, and typography in map making. 
    Students will also be introduced to concepts and processes that are central to cartography, enabling the student to build a cartographic foundation for subsequent studies. 
    Industry standard, graphic design software will be used to create various paper products and screen images.
